Recently it was discovered that in\na many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence\nacross the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase\ntransition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different\nparts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe\nexperimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially\ncostly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the\nsimulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the\ndiscovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed\nexperimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase\ntransition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is\nfully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum\ninformation is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change\nin the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in\nthe process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each\nblock the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the\ntransition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of\nrepetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions\nis increased.

The introduction of Reinforcement Learning in autonomous driving\npresents a promising solution to these challenges, although concerns about\nsafety and efficiency during training remain major obstacles to its widespread\napplication. To address these concerns, we propose a novel framework named\nSimple to Complex Collaborative Decision. First, we rapidly train the teacher\nmodel using the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm in a lightweight\nautonomous driving simulation environment. In the more complex simulation\nenvironment, the teacher model intervenes when the student agent exhibits\nsub-optimal behavior by assessing the value of actions to avert dangerous\nsituations. Next, we developed an innovative algorithm called Adaptive Clipping\nProximal Policy Optimization. It trains using a combination of samples\ngenerated by both the teacher and student policies and applies dynamic clipping\nstrategies based on sample importance, enabling the algorithm to utilize\nsamples from diverse sources more efficiently. Additionally, we employ the KL\ndivergence between the teacher's and student's policies as a constraint for\npolicy optimization to facilitate the student agent's rapid learning of the\nteacher's policy. Finally, by adopting an appropriate weaning strategy to\ngradually reduce teacher intervention, we ensure that the student agent can\nfully explore the environment independently during the later stages of\ntraining.

In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to\nillustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing\ndetailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.\n","authors":["Hazhar Rahmani","Abhishek N.

This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a\n2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\\sim$ 9 $\\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total\nmeasurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\\times340$ $\\mu$m$^2$ field\nof view with a $\\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic\nrange of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based\non differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging\ncapabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to\nmeasure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.\n","authors":["Luca Basso","Pauli Kehayias","Jacob Henshaw","Gajadhar Joshi","Michael P.

We present\na detailed muon spin relaxation study of the influence of chemical composition\nand sample processing protocols on the magnetic phase transitions and spin\ndynamics of several different Cantor alloy samples. Specific samples studied\ninclude a pristine equiatomic sample, samples with deficient and excess Mn\ncontent, and equiatomic samples magnetized in a field of 9 T or plastically\ndeformed in pressures up to 0.5 GPa. The results confirm the sensitive\ndependence of the transition temperature on composition and demonstrate that\npost-synthesis pressure treatments cause the transition to become significantly\nless homogeneous throughout the sample volume. In addition, we observe critical\nspin dynamics in the vicinity of the transition in all samples, reminiscent of\ncanonical spin glasses and magnetic materials with ideal continuous phase\ntransitions. Application of an external magnetic field suppresses the critical\ndynamics in the Mn-deficient sample, while the equiatomic and Mn-rich samples\nshow more robust critical dynamics. The spin-flip thermal activation energy in\nthe paramagnetic phase increases with Mn content, ranging from $3.1(3) \\times\n10^{-21}$ J for 0% Mn to $1.2(2) \\times 10^{-20}$ J for 30% Mn content.

Even if for a given realization of the quenched random\nmedium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an\nexponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line,\nquantifying how the system forgets its initial state as it nears the depinning\ntransition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale\ndepends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor\nreveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to\nfundamental limits to predictability.\n","authors":["Valtteri Haavisto","Marcin Mińkowski","Lasse Laurson"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11030v2.pdf","comment":"19 pages, 13 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04019v2","updated":"2024-10-22T11:52:07Z","published":"2024-05-07T05:32:26Z","title":"Generalized Langevin dynamics for single beads in linear elastic network","summary":"  We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear\nelastic networks.

It\nfeatures three available cabins for instrumentation and plans to install six\nsingle-pixel heterodyne receivers, covering different bandwidths in the 30 to\n950 GHz window of the electromagnetic spectrum, in its two lateral Nasmyth\ncabins at different phases of the project. Therefore, it is crucial not only to\ndesign a tertiary optical system that couples the antenna beam to those\nreceivers, but also to do it in a scalable way. The primary goal for the design\nis to simultaneously maximize the antenna efficiency while minimizing optical\naberrations for all receivers, both fundamental aspects for the optimal\nfunctioning of cutting-edge astronomical instruments. In this paper, we present\nthe entire design process, starting from the quasi-optical approach based on\nthe propagation of a fundamental Gaussian beam mode, continuing with the\nvalidation of the design based on physical optics simulations, and ending with\na tolerance analysis of the system. As a result of this process, a frequency\nindependent tertiary optical system has been achieved for almost all the\nreceivers, which is expected to provide high optical performance for the radio\ntelescope.\n","authors":["Emiliano Rasztocky","Matias Rolf Hampel","Rodrigo Reeves","Jacques R.

Based on desired type-I, II error levels $\\alpha, \\beta\n\\in (0,1)$, it stops when the likelihood ratio statistic crosses certain upper\nand lower thresholds, guaranteeing optimality of the expected sample size.\nHowever, these thresholds are not closed form and the test is often applied\nwith approximate thresholds $(1-\\beta)/\\alpha$ and $\\beta/(1-\\alpha)$\n(approximate SPRT). When $\\beta > 0$, this neither guarantees type I,II error\ncontrol at $\\alpha,\\beta$ nor optimality. When $\\beta=0$ (power-one SPRT), it\nguarantees type I error control at $\\alpha$ that is in general conservative,\nand thus not optimal. The looseness in both cases is caused by overshoot: the\ntest statistic overshoots the thresholds at the stopping time. One standard way\nto address this is to calculate the right thresholds numerically, but many\npapers and software packages do not do this. In this paper, we describe a\ndifferent way to improve the approximate SPRT: we change the test statistic to\navoid overshoot.

Being an effective strategy, while\ncaging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided\nrobust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict\nrequirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed\ncontacts, or specific geometries of the robots or the objects. To this end,\nthis work proposes a novel concept, termed Caging in Time, to allow caging\nconfigurations to be formed even if there is just one robot engaged in a task.\nThis novel concept can be explained by an insight that even if a caging\nconfiguration is needed to constrain the motion of an object, only a small\nportion of the cage is actively manipulating at a time. As such, we can switch\nthe configuration of the robot strategically so that by collapsing its\nconfiguration in time, we will see a cage formed and its necessary portion\nactive whenever needed. We instantiate our Caging in Time theory on challenging\nquasistatic and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be\nachieved in general state spaces including geometry-based and energy-based\nspaces. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation,\nin an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object\ngeometry or physical properties, nor realtime accurate feedback on the\nmanipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop\nmanipulation solution, the proposed theory can be a supplementary strategy to\nother manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.\n","authors":["Gaotian Wang","Kejia Ren","Andrew S.

Previous\nstudies concentrated on the mechanism of translational motion in vdW\ninterfaces. However, detailed mechanisms and general properties of the\nrotational motion are barely explored. Here, we combine experiments and\nsimulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite\nheterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the\nsuperlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational\nresistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic\nrotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes\nduring the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite\nheterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and\nthe estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The\nformation of Moir\\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to\ncontrolling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene\nheterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even\nif the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy\nchange results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force. The structural\nchange of the heterostructure can be an additional pathway for energy\ndissipation in the rotational motion, further enhancing the rotational friction\nforce.\n","authors":["Mengzhou Liao","Andrea Silva","Luojun Du","Paolo Nicolini","Victor E.

Moreover, the Wigner\ndistributions show that the Wigner distribution of the extended wave function\nis localized in the momentum direction of the phase space, while that of the\ncritical wave function is sub-extended in the momentum direction of the phase\nspace. Based on the results of entanglement entropy, the extended-critical\ntransition is a thermodynamic phase transition because it is accompanied by\ndecreasing entropy. We engineer a quantum heat cycle engine with the\nextended-critical quasicrystal as the working medium, and find that there are\nrich working modes in the engine, such as quantum accelerator, quantum heater\nand quantum heat engine.\n  Importantly, the extended quasicrystals are more conducive to the realization\nof quantum heat engines, while the critical quasicrystals are more conducive to\nthe realization of quantum heaters. Our work is an important step toward\nexploring the rich thermodynamic applications of Fibonacci quasicrystals.\n","authors":["He-Guang Xu","Shujie Cheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17550v1.pdf","comment":"6 pages, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545v2","updated":"2024-10-23T01:30:30Z","published":"2023-09-07T08:06:05Z","title":"Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown\n  model parameters from partial observations","summary":"  Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled\noscillators, such as neurons in the brain, is of utmost importance.

Here we address this\nquestion in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe\nparticle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped\nrun-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the\neffective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the\nactive nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation.\nIn the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled\nby a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at\nthe two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state\n(NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We\ncharacterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial\nand temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy\ncurrent flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads\nto the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the\nactivities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest\nin the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations.

The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the\nreduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in\nsystems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the\nevolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably\ndiminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of\noperators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis.

The\nrelation between the residualization methodology and the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell\n(FWL) theorem is also analyzed, concluding that, although both provide the same\nestimations, the interpretation of the estimated coefficients is different.\nThese different interpretations justify the application of the residualization\nmethodology regardless of the FWL theorem.

DynamicCity mainly consists of two\nkey models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D\nrepresentation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity\nemploys a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D LiDAR features\ninto six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly\nenhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we\nutilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in\nparallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction\naccuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x\ntraining speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model\nfor HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded\nRollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the\nHexPlane as a squared 2D feature map.

Designers of versatile and stronger\nwearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very\ntorque-dense, backdrivable and efficient.\n  This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue:\nreconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate\na passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still\nbe multifunctional.

Objective: The focus of this study is to develop a\nmethod for performing internal DIC measurements in dynamic experiments. The aim\nis to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy across a range of stresses (up\nto 650MPa), strain rates ($10^3$-$10^6$ s$^{-1}$), and high-strain rate loading\nconditions (e.g., ramped and shock wave loading). Methods: Internal DIC is\ndeveloped based on the concept of applying a speckle pattern at an inner-plane\nof a transparent specimen. The high-speed imaging configuration is then focused\non the internal speckle pattern.
