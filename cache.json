Recently it was discovered that in\na many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence\nacross the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase\ntransition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different\nparts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe\nexperimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially\ncostly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the\nsimulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the\ndiscovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed\nexperimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase\ntransition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is\nfully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum\ninformation is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change\nin the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in\nthe process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each\nblock the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the\ntransition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of\nrepetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions\nis increased.

The introduction of Reinforcement Learning in autonomous driving\npresents a promising solution to these challenges, although concerns about\nsafety and efficiency during training remain major obstacles to its widespread\napplication. To address these concerns, we propose a novel framework named\nSimple to Complex Collaborative Decision. First, we rapidly train the teacher\nmodel using the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm in a lightweight\nautonomous driving simulation environment. In the more complex simulation\nenvironment, the teacher model intervenes when the student agent exhibits\nsub-optimal behavior by assessing the value of actions to avert dangerous\nsituations. Next, we developed an innovative algorithm called Adaptive Clipping\nProximal Policy Optimization. It trains using a combination of samples\ngenerated by both the teacher and student policies and applies dynamic clipping\nstrategies based on sample importance, enabling the algorithm to utilize\nsamples from diverse sources more efficiently. Additionally, we employ the KL\ndivergence between the teacher's and student's policies as a constraint for\npolicy optimization to facilitate the student agent's rapid learning of the\nteacher's policy. Finally, by adopting an appropriate weaning strategy to\ngradually reduce teacher intervention, we ensure that the student agent can\nfully explore the environment independently during the later stages of\ntraining.

In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to\nillustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing\ndetailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.\n","authors":["Hazhar Rahmani","Abhishek N.

The microscope is\nequipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and\nthe MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in\nthe Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a\n2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\\sim$ 9 $\\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total\nmeasurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\\times340$ $\\mu$m$^2$ field\nof view with a $\\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic\nrange of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based\non differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging\ncapabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to\nmeasure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.\n","authors":["Luca Basso","Pauli Kehayias","Jacob Henshaw","Gajadhar Joshi","Michael P.

Here, we study\nthe predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random\nmedia driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex\nsystem exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous\nnon-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of\nmachine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial\nrelaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the\nsample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the\ndepinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random\nmedium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an\nexponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line,\nquantifying how the system forgets its initial state as it nears the depinning\ntransition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale\ndepends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor\nreveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to\nfundamental limits to predictability.\n","authors":["Valtteri Haavisto","Marcin MiÅkowski","Lasse Laurson"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11030v2.pdf","comment":"19 pages, 13 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04019v2","updated":"2024-10-22T11:52:07Z","published":"2024-05-07T05:32:26Z","title":"Generalized Langevin dynamics for single beads in linear elastic network","summary":"  We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear\nelastic networks.

They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) --\na single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial\nsimilarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical\nchaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an\nappropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly\nunstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this\nconjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The\ndynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not\ndisplay chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit.

This general framework\nallows an analyst to focus on a single node, a specific region of interest, or\ncompare whole networks. Our ability to conduct \"mesoscale\" testing on a\nmeaningful group of edges is particularly relevant for applications such as\nneuroimaging and distinguishes our approach from prior work, which tends to\nfocus either on a single node or the whole network. In this mesoscale setting,\nwe develop statistically sound projection-based tests for two-sample comparison\nin both weighted and binary edge networks. Our approach can leverage all\navailable network information, and learn informative projections which improve\ntesting power when low-dimensional latent network structure is present.\n","authors":["Peter W.

A connection to an\ninteresting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had\nbeen conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1\ncorrespond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the\ngenerators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse\nelectric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another\nmathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of\ndiscs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively\ndifferent from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several\ntimes. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with\nremarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern\nsolid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally\npacked discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi\ntessellations.\n","authors":["A.

Based on desired type-I, II error levels $\\alpha, \\beta\n\\in (0,1)$, it stops when the likelihood ratio statistic crosses certain upper\nand lower thresholds, guaranteeing optimality of the expected sample size.\nHowever, these thresholds are not closed form and the test is often applied\nwith approximate thresholds $(1-\\beta)/\\alpha$ and $\\beta/(1-\\alpha)$\n(approximate SPRT). When $\\beta > 0$, this neither guarantees type I,II error\ncontrol at $\\alpha,\\beta$ nor optimality. When $\\beta=0$ (power-one SPRT), it\nguarantees type I error control at $\\alpha$ that is in general conservative,\nand thus not optimal. The looseness in both cases is caused by overshoot: the\ntest statistic overshoots the thresholds at the stopping time. One standard way\nto address this is to calculate the right thresholds numerically, but many\npapers and software packages do not do this. In this paper, we describe a\ndifferent way to improve the approximate SPRT: we change the test statistic to\navoid overshoot.

Being an effective strategy, while\ncaging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided\nrobust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict\nrequirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed\ncontacts, or specific geometries of the robots or the objects. To this end,\nthis work proposes a novel concept, termed Caging in Time, to allow caging\nconfigurations to be formed even if there is just one robot engaged in a task.\nThis novel concept can be explained by an insight that even if a caging\nconfiguration is needed to constrain the motion of an object, only a small\nportion of the cage is actively manipulating at a time. As such, we can switch\nthe configuration of the robot strategically so that by collapsing its\nconfiguration in time, we will see a cage formed and its necessary portion\nactive whenever needed. We instantiate our Caging in Time theory on challenging\nquasistatic and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be\nachieved in general state spaces including geometry-based and energy-based\nspaces. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation,\nin an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object\ngeometry or physical properties, nor realtime accurate feedback on the\nmanipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop\nmanipulation solution, the proposed theory can be a supplementary strategy to\nother manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.\n","authors":["Gaotian Wang","Kejia Ren","Andrew S.

Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity\nemploys a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D LiDAR features\ninto six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly\nenhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain).

However, the task becomes more challenging when the focus is on\nthe exploration of planet surfaces such as Mars. In those situations, UGVs are\nforced to navigate through unstable and rugged terrains which, inevitably, open\nthe vehicle to more hazards, accidents, and, in extreme cases, complete mission\nfailure. The paper addresses the challenges of autonomous navigation for\nunmanned ground vehicles in planetary exploration, particularly on Mars,\nintroducing a hybrid architecture for terrain traversability analysis that\ncombines two approaches: appearance-based and geometry-based. The\nappearance-based method uses semantic segmentation via deep neural networks to\nclassify different terrain types. This is further refined by pixel-level\nterrain roughness classification obtained from the same RGB image, assigning\ndifferent costs based on the physical properties of the soil. The\ngeometry-based method complements the appearance-based approach by evaluating\nthe terrain's geometrical features, identifying hazards that may not be\ndetectable by the appearance-based side.

The aim\nis to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy across a range of stresses (up\nto 650MPa), strain rates ($10^3$-$10^6$ s$^{-1}$), and high-strain rate loading\nconditions (e.g., ramped and shock wave loading). Methods: Internal DIC is\ndeveloped based on the concept of applying a speckle pattern at an inner-plane\nof a transparent specimen. The high-speed imaging configuration is then focused\non the internal speckle pattern. During the dynamic experiment, in-plane,\ntwo-dimensional deformations are measured via correlation of the internal\nspeckle pattern. Results: The internal DIC experimental technique is\nsuccessfully demonstrated in both the SHPB and plate impact experiments. In the\nSHPB setting, the accuracy of the technique is excellent throughout the\ndeformation regime, with measurement noise of approximately 0.2% strain. For\nplate impact experiments, the technique performs well, with error and\nmeasurement noise of 1% strain. Conclusion: The internal DIC technique has been\ndeveloped and demonstrated to work well for full-scale dynamic high-strain rate\nand shock laboratory experiments, and the accuracy is quantified. The technique\ncan aid in investigating the physics and mechanics of the dynamic behavior of\nmaterials, including local deformation fields around dynamically loaded\nmaterial heterogeneities.\n","authors":["Barry P Lawlor","Vatsa Gandhi","Guruswami Ravichandran"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17493v1.pdf","comment":null}]}}
